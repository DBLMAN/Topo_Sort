You can use the functions in topoGraph_viz.py to either print a graph in the format accepted
by GraphViz, or to create a file with this information in it.

print_graph_viz_representation(graph_file_name) prints the information to the console 

create_graph_viz_file_for(graph_file_name) prints it to a file named with the 
   function argument appended with ".graph_viz"
   
Go to this site: http://www.webgraphviz.com/ and copy the GraphViz data into the
   text box, click the 'Generate Graph!' button and see your graph.
